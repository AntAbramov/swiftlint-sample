This repository provides a generic SwiftLint configuration file that can be used by anyone to write clean and readable code using the Swift programming language, without deep-diving into the configuration itself.

It is a good way to improve the quality of your code, as well as to learn new swift language tips.

If you think a rule (opt_in or custom) should be in this generic SwiftLint file, send a pull request with suggestions.
